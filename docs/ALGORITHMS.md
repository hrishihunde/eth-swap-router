# What are the key algorithms involved, and how are they different?

We use 2 Single-Source-Shortest-Path algorithms in this project, namely: 

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Post-Sorting-Barrier Dijkstra, an improvement to the original algorithm [(Duan, et al. (2025))](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17033)
